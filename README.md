# Call-Center-Analysis

**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing call center data to derive actionable insights that can improve operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and agent performance. The analysis includes metrics such as call volume, average handling time, first call resolution, customer satisfaction scores, and agent performance. The goal is to identify trends, bottlenecks, and opportunities for optimization in call center operations.

The project is built using Power BI for data visualization and analysis, and the raw data is provided in CSV format for transparency and reproducibility. The repository includes the raw data, Power BI report, and documentation to recreate the analysis.

**Key Features**

    Data Analysis:

        Call volume trends over time.

        Average handling time (AHT) by agent and department.

        First call resolution (FCR) rates.

        Customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores.

        Agent performance metrics (e.g., calls handled, resolution rate).

   Visualizations:

        Interactive dashboards in Power BI.

        Key performance indicators (KPIs) for quick insights.

        Trend analysis using line charts and bar graphs.

   Data Sources:

        Raw call center data in CSV format

DashBoard Discriptions

**1) Metric Overview** 

The Metric Overview Dashboard provides a high-level summary of the call center's key performance indicators (KPIs). It is designed to give managers and stakeholders a quick snapshot of the overall performance and health of the call center operations.
**Key Metrics:**

    Total Calls Received

    Average Handling Time (AHT)

    First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate

    Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Score

**2. Agent and Topic Performance** 


The Agent and Topic Performance Dashboard focuses on individual agent performance and the efficiency of handling specific topics or issues. It helps identify top-performing agents, training needs, and topic-specific bottlenecks.
**Key Metrics:**

    Calls Handled per Agent

    Average Handling Time (AHT) per Agent

    First Call Resolution (FCR) Rate per Agent

    Topic-wise Call Volume

    Topic-wise Resolution Rate

**3. Call Volume Analysis**

The Call Volume Analysis Dashboard provides insights into call patterns, including peak call times, call distribution by channel, and trends over time. It helps in resource planning and identifying high-demand periods.
**Key Metrics:**

    Total Calls by Hour/Day/Week

    Call Volume by Channel (e.g., phone, email, chat)

    Peak Call Times

    Call Volume Trends Over Time

**4. Call Outcome Distribution** 

The Call Outcome Distribution Dashboard analyzes the outcomes of calls, such as resolved, escalated, or abandoned. It helps identify areas for improvement in call handling and resolution processes.
**Key Metrics:**

    Call Outcome Distribution (e.g., resolved, escalated, abandoned)

    Escalation Rate

    Abandonment Rate

    Resolution Rate by Topic

**5. Summary** 

The Summary Dashboard consolidates the key insights from all other dashboards into a single, comprehensive view. It is designed for executive-level stakeholders who need a quick, high-level overview of call center performance.
**Key Metrics:**

    Overall Call Center Performance (e.g., total calls, AHT, FCR, CSAT)

    Agent Performance Summary

    Call Volume Trends

    Call Outcome Summary

**Key Insights**

    Identified peak call times and recommended staffing adjustments.

    Highlighted agents with the highest and lowest performance metrics.

    Discovered correlations between average handling time and customer satisfaction.

    Provided actionable recommendations to improve first call resolution rates.

**Tools and Technologies**

    Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

    Excel/CSV: For raw data storage and preprocessing.
